st.write('Mental health among university students is a critical issue that can impact their ability to succeed academically and personally. In this project, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to better understand the prevalence of three of the most common mental health disorders among university students: depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Through a variety of data visualization techniques, the relationship between these disorders and factors such as gender, age, and academic level were explored. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends in mental health among university students, in order to improve understanding and attention to these critical health challenges')

                As for the difference between freshmen and seniors in terms of panic attacks, it could be the result of several factors. It is possible that freshmen are experiencing a higher level of stress due to the transition to college life, while seniors may have developed better stress and anxiety management skills over time.
                It is also possible that fourth-year students have learned to avoid situations that trigger their panic attacks or have sought treatment for their anxiety, which may explain why they have a lower incidence of panic attacks compared to first-year students.
